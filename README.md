# CLI Flappy Bird

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game built in multiple programming languages.

## Overview

This project implements the same Flappy Bird game in different programming languages:
- Python
- Rust
- Go
- C
- C++

Each implementation is contained in its own directory named after the language.

## How to Play

- Press **Space** or **Up Arrow** key to make the bird fly
- Press **R** to restart the game
- Press **Q** to quit

## Scoring

The game keeps track of your score as you navigate through obstacles. Try to beat your high score!

## Customization

You can modify the game mechanics by changing the following variables in the source code (variable names may vary between implementations):
- Gravity strength
- Flap power
- Gap size between obstacles
